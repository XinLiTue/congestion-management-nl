# Workshop on Congestion Management in Netherlands  
## Challenges, Lessons and Future Expectations

---

### <span style="color:#0077b6;">Background</span>

<div style="font-size:1.1em;">
With rapid energy transition and economic growth in the Netherlands, grid capacity is under unprecedented pressure. Most regions now face insufficient capacity for electrical system operationâ€”known as grid congestion. Large consumers above 60 MW are required to participate in congestion management, but practical implementation and future expectations remain key challenges.

### <span style="color:#0077b6;">Overview</span>

<div style="font-size:1.1em;">
As grid congestion becomes a critical issue, congestion management stands out as the most efficient solution. This workshop gathers researchers and professionals in power systems, control, and related fields to exchange insights. Through expert lectures, structured discussions, and poster sessions, we aim to foster multidisciplinary collaboration, share the latest developments, and connect young researchers with the field's pioneers.
